    "response": "Based on the data, I would recommend betting the under on Stephen Curry scoring 28.5 points against the Boston Celtics. Here's why:\n\n**Stephen Curry's Recent Performance:**\n- Over his last 10 games, Curry has averaged 24.3 points per game, falling below the 28.5 points threshold.\n- In those 10 games, Curry surpassed the 28.5 point mark in only 3 out of the 10 games, indicating a trend of being under that target.\n\n**Boston Celtics' Defense:**\n- The Celtics have shown strong defensive stats, including recording 584 blocks and 631 steals across 91 games, making it challenging for opponents to score efficiently.\n- Additionally, the Celtics have held their opponents to an average of 108.91 points per game, showcasing their ability to limit the scoring output of key players like Curry.",
